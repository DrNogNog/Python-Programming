The article claims that researchers have been “fine-tuning a computer system that is trying to
master semantics by learning more like a human.” Based on the article and your own
experiences programming computers (in circuit diagrams, assembly language, and Python),
how do computers operate and learn differently from the way humans do? Are there any
similarities?
Computers operate and learn differently from the way humans do because, they associate
words with common emotions when describing things. However, sometimes in the english
language, a word can be used to describe two different things, but with similar sentences, one
could be in a whole nother realm of understanding.
The NELL system had to have human help in order to avoid the cascade of mistaken
conclusions from the statement, “I deleted my Internet cookies.” Do you believe
machine-learning systems (like NELL or others) will always need human assistance such as
this, or will they be able to overcome such problems in the future? Give a brief explanation for
your thoughts.
I believe machine learning systems will soon not need human assistance. As we add more to a
machine’s word bank and its understanding of words, it could even start deciding which
emotions to display. However, the english dictionary is ever expanding and there’s no telling
when will be the last human update.
